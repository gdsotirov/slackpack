=head1 NAME

SlackPack::Slackver - A general representation of a slackware version

=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $sver = new SlackPack::Slackver(110);

print "Slackware " . $sver->{name} . " released " . $sver->{released};
$sver->get_all;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a class which represents a Slackware version. It incorporates all
the data of the version and provides method for listing all available
versions.

=head1 CONSTANTS

This class redefines some constants from SlackPack::Object

=over

=item C<DB_TABLE>

The database table for the versions is 'slackver'.

=head2 Constructors

=over

=item C<new($id)>

 Description: The constructor is used to load a architecture object from
              the database by its identifier.


 Params:      $id - You should pass the identifier of the architecture, which
                    is integer. The identifier is composite integer number. It
                    is computed from the major and minor versions of the
                    Slackware version by the following formula:

=over

identifier = major * 10 + minor

=back

                    Thus the identifier of Slackware 11.0 will be 110 and the
                    identifier of Slackware 9.1 will be 91.

 Returns:     A fully initialized object.

=back

=head2 General methods

=over

=item C<get_all>

 Description: This method lists all defined versions in the database.

 Returns:     List of fully initialized version objects.
