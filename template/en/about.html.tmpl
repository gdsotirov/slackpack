<h2>About the site</h2>
<p class="text">This is Georgi Sotirov's <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>
Packages site or simply SlackPack. The site gives web interface to my
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> packages repository.</p>

<p class="text">The idea for this site come when I have got close to hundred
packages, which I wanted to be more accessible, more easy to find. Till this
time my packages were only placed on an ftp server and some of them were
registered at <a href="http://www.linuxpackages.net/search_view.php?cstat=17846">linuxpackages</a>.
However I decided to create my own site and publish my packages mainly there
still relaying on <a href="http://www.linuxpackages.net/">linuxpackages.net</a>
to spread my work.</p>

<p class="text">I started building packages since the beginning of 2005,
because I wanted to keep my Slackware system clean and easy upgradeable.
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> is a good distribution, but
when it comes to software packages you cannot expect to just find such (like
it is a case with an rpm based distribution). So because I have specific
needs and I use more software than the official packages provide, I'm now
doing packages for everything that is not available anywhere else or I need
some special functionality that is not available in the other packages. I'm
open person, so I share my packages to anyone with the hope that they will be
useful.</p>

<p class="text">I always try to build good packages, though there is <strong>
no any guarantee</strong> that my packages will work for you (and not even for
me :-). Most of my packages are built for the Intel 486 architecture (one
exception are packages build from binary releases - [% percent_binrel %] % of
all). The current distribution is:</p>

<table id="DstrbtnByArch">
<caption>Packages distribution by Architecture</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Architecture</th>
<th>Count</th>
<th>Percent</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
[% FOREACH line = dstrbtn_by_arch %]
<tr>
<td>[% line.Name %]</td>
<td>[% line.Count %]</td>
<td>[% line.Percent %] %</td>
</tr>
[% END %]
</tbody>
</table>

<p class="text">My packages generally follow the requirements of
<a href="http://www.linuxpackages.net/">linuxpackages.net</a> and I use their
system wide utility script for writing my build scripts. At this time 
[%+ percent_sb %] % of my packages are produced with a build scripts, but this
will increase over time, because my latest packages are all build by build
scripts. This keep things transparent to users and they can even build the
package by themselves if they want to. I publish my sources and include them
in the package.</p>

<p class="text">Some of my packages are build against
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>
Current (about [% percent_cur %] %) and this is banned by
<a href="http://www.linuxpackages.net/">linuxpackages.net</a>, but I'll keep
them for now since they still can be useful and I actually use some of them.
My latest packages are always build on the latest
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> official release thus
ensuring the dependencies and that the package will work on the user's system.
When you have the choice do not download packages build on
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> Current.</p>

<p class="text">Hope you like my packages and they are useful for you.<br />
Enjoy the site!<br /><br />Happy surfing ;-)</p>
