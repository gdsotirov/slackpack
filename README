SlackPack README

About
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SlackPack was initially intended to be only a web interface to the
Slackware package repositories of Georgi Sotirov. Currently however it is
becoming more like a system for management of Slackware packages. Still there
is much work to be done, e.g. all the backend system for editing existing and
registering new packages is not ready. This however is under way for the next
release.
  SlackPack interface is presenting the user with a way to search and browse
packages by category or Slackware version. Packages can be completely
reviewed before download. In future registered users will be able to post
comments to the packages and request new package builds. You can keep current
with the variety of site feeds that are offered.
  Advanced users may find the repositories useful for automatic update with
tools like swaret and slapt-get.
  Most of SlackPack is written in Perl using a bunch of handy modules like
Template, File and Date. Site interface is XHTML styled with CSS with few
simple JavaScripts. Some handy tolls are written in shell.
